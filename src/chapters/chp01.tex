\begin{theorem}{A}
    Let $f$ be a function whose derivative exists in every point, then $f$
    is a continuous function.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    To prove it by contradiction try and assume that the statemenet is false,
    proceed from there and at some point you will arrive to a contradiction.
\end{proof}
