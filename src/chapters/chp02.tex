\section{Taylor Series}

\begin{theorem}[Taylor's Theorem]
    Let $f$ be a function whose derivative exists in every point, then $f$
    is a continuous function.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    To prove it by contradiction try and assume that the statemenet is false,
    proceed from there and at some point you will arrive to a contradiction.
\end{proof}

$$\Gamma (z+1) = z \Gamma (z)$$

$$\Gamma (z) = \frac {\Gamma (z+n+1)}{(z)_n}$$
