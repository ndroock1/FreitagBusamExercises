\section{Euclid}

A prime number is a positive integer not equal to $1$ which is divisible only by $1$ and itself.

The sequence of prime numbers starts with
$$2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97, \ldots$$

The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic claims that every integer greater than 1 either is a prime number itself or can be
represented as the product of prime numbers and that, moreover, this representation is unique, up to (except for) the
order of the factors. So, if
$$p_1=2, p_2=3, p_3=5, \ldots$$
and in general $p_n$ is equal to the $n$-th prime number and $a>1$ is a positive integer, then
$$a=p_{\alpha_1}^{b_1} \ldots p_{\alpha_\nu}^{b_\nu}$$
where $\nu \geq 1, 1 \leq \alpha_1 < \alpha_2 \ldots < \alpha_\nu$ and the sum of the exponents $b_i \geq 1$, is the
unique representation of $a$.

Euclid proved the infinitude of the primes. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic does not imply the infinitude of
primes because a finite number of primes can generate an infinitude of integers through the infinite possibilities of
varying the prime exponents. Euclid's proof is simply the following. If there would be a finite number of primes then
every integer $>1$ would be divisible by at least one of these primes. However, the number
$$p_1 p_2 \ldots p_\delta + 1$$
is not divisible by $p_1$, nor by $p_2 \ldots$, nor by $p_\delta$ because the remainder in all these cases would be 1.
Therefore the number of primes is infinite.
